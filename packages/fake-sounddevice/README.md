# fake-sounddevice

A fake sounddevice package for testing that provides the same interface as the `sounddevice`
package but emulates audio devices rather than working with real sound hardware.

## Purpose

This package is designed for testing applications that use `sounddevice` without requiring
actual audio hardware.
